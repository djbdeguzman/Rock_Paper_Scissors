# Rock_Paper_Scissors

08/16/2022 - The repository was uploaded with a very basic functionality.
the player was asked for the selection via prompt, and the result is displayed by console log.

08/23/2022 - I edited the html and js, I added buttons and display for the score, the whole javascript code was edited. Whoever is the first one to get the score of 5 wins the game. Is any of the player wins, the selection button will be disabled and the reset game button will show.
